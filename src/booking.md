<h3>Gig info</h3>
To book a show, [email us](mailto:info@brivele.com) at info (at) brivele (dot) com.</br></br>
We play Seattle often, sometimes venture around the PNW (Portland, Bellingham, etc), and about once a year tour elsewhere, so far in the US and Canada. We love to play house shows, bookshops, bars, outdoor shows, synogogues, cafes, communal art spaces, basements, attics, district courts, basketball courts, and everything in between (highways?). In addition to music events we welcome collaborations on workshops, shpils, actions, fundraisers, celebrations, shabbos, havdalah, holidays, and other ritual.</br></br>
A few things to note:</br>
<ul>
<li>As of 2024, we play as a duo comprised of Stefanie and Maia. (For life-juggling reasons, Hannah is moving on from the band.)</li>
<li>We can play with or without a sound system, but in larger or louder spaces it's definitely helpful to have one. Our sound needs are 2 vocal mics, 1 instrument DI, and 1 instrument mic.</li>
<li>Our show energy is intimate with a lot of audience interaction. We are *not* great background music for shmoozing, so if your event will involve a lot of speeches, we're better for the opening than for the end. We're also not a dance band &mdash; for your Jewish wedding or b'nai mitzvah we recommend Stef's brass band [Shpilkis](https://www.shpilkisseattle.com/) or our friends [Kesselgarden](https://sites.google.com/site/kesselgardenhomepage/). Otherwise, if you need politically cutting screamo, complex harmony, or just a lot of Yiddish, please reach out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blurb</h3>
<p>Brivele is a Seattle-based ensemble who braid together Yiddish song, anti-fascist and labor balladry, folk-punk, and contemporary rabble-rousing in stirring vocal harmony. In Yiddish, Brivele (בריוועלע) means "little letter." Our songs are love letters to diaspora, sent through time and over borders.</p>

<!--<li>In recent years, for childcare reasons, we play many of our shows as a duo comprised of Stefanie and Maia. This is especially likely for shows outside of Seattle. But not always!</li>
<li>We can play with or without a sound system, but in larger or louder spaces it's definitely helpful to have one. Our sound needs are 3 vocal mics, 2 instrument DIs, and 1-2 instrument mics.</li>-->
