<p class='follow'>The best and only place to get our studio recordings online is on <a href='https://brivele.bandcamp.com/merch'>Bandcamp</a></p>
<figure><a href='https://brivele.bandcamp.com/music'><img src='../images/musicpage/bandcampthumbnails.png'></a></figure>
<p>You can also buy a CD at a show (or contact us and we'll mail you one).</p><p>From Bandcamp you can stream, download mp3s to your local hard drive, or order a CD to play in your car, stereo, or discman that you still have from 1997. Most of the money from your purchases will go directly to us. No one will know the number of times you do or don't listen to each song. Your access will not depend on the whims of an unaccountable corporation. Although as life is still ephemeral, you may wake up to find the CD melted in the car.</p>
